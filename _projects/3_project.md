Originally established in <a href="https://taps.unl.edu/">Nebraska</a> and later expanded to the Oklahoma panhandle region, the TAPS program allows farmers to interactively compete using a variety of efficient strategies and technologies with a goal to reduce water & energy consumption while optimizing profits and yield. After years of success, the TAPS program is eager to incorporate other environmental indicators, like greenhouse gas emissions and nutrient leaching, to the competition. Our team has begun with modeling greenhouse gas emissions associated with energy consumption, materials, transportation, field management, and direct soil emissions from microbial processes. Together, we are working to incorporate life cycle greenhouse gas emissions to the competition as another metric to optimize.
