This outreach and education group was formed by Drs. Mary Foltz and Jaime Schussler. The team, named Gals in Green Infrastructure or GiGI, merges Mary and Jaime's love for green infrastructure (or low-impact development, or nature-based solutions) to address water quality and quantity issues. Together, GiGI has presented outreach and education for Oklahoma State University, Women in Science, and Girl Scouts of America. They like to host hands-on activities related to water quality, water treatment, and green infrastruture. Example activities include water quality testing with test strips and probes, demonstrations of water treatment processes like flocculation, and activities constructing biofilters from natural and engineered materials.
