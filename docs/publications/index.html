            <p>Two common tree species, ash (
              Fraxinus
              sp.) and oak (
              Quercus
              sp.), could provide readily available media for denitrifying bioreactors that use wood-based carbon for biological nitrate treatment. However, it is not known if the wood from Emerald Ash Borer-killed (EAB-killed) ash trees is an effective carbon source for nitrate removal compared to other wood species or if the high-tannin nature of oak inhibits denitrification potential. This lab-scale study showed that EAB-killed ash woodchips did not significantly differ in nitrate removal or denitrification potential compared to a commercially available blend of hardwood chips. However, neither treatment performed as well as oak woodchips in these metrics. Use of high-tannin oak in bioreactors is currently restricted by a federal standard in the United States. Ash woodchips beneficially exhibited the lowest nitrous oxide production potential, and their dissolved phosphorus leaching fell within the range of other woodchip types. Emerald ash borer-killed ash wood could be an effective source for denitrifying bioreactors located within affected regions and oak woodchips merit additional investigation for the application of denitrifying bioreactors.</p>

            <p>There is evidence that participation in summer engineering camps facilitates students’ understanding of the work engineers do, which can influence their decisions toward selecting engineering majors in college and engineering career paths [1]. The Environmental Engineering and Sustainability summer camp for high school students has been offered at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign since 2012, under the summer camp outreach umbrella of the Grainger College of Engineering [2]. The week-long camp includes hands-on activities aimed to introduce students to engineering design, scientific inquiry, sustainability, and how engineers contribute to protecting human health and the environment. In summer 2020, due to the pandemic, the camp was reformatted from in-person to virtual. The virtual platform enabled the camp to reach more students, especially those with limited resources to attend an in-person camp. Therefore, we believe it is worth reflecting on the benefits and challenges of this reformatted summer camp and suggest ways online student experience can be improved in the future.</p>

            <p>Treatment of nitrate loads by denitrifying bioreactors in centralized drainage ditches that receive subsurface tile drainage may offer a more effective alternative to end-of-pipe bioreactors. A paired denitrifying bioreactor design, consisting of an in-ditch bioreactor (18.3 × 2.1 × 0.2 m) treating ditch base ﬂow and a diversion bioreactor (4.6 × 9.1 × 0.9 m) designed to treat high-ﬂow events, was designed and constructed in an agricultural watershed (3.2 km2 drainage area) in Illinois, USA. Flow and water chemistry were monitored for three years and the woodchip and bioreactor-associated soil were analyzed for denitriﬁcation potential and chemical properties after 25 months. The inditch bioreactor did not signiﬁcantly reduce nitrate concentrations in the ditch, likely due to low hydraulic connectivity with stream water and sedimentation. The diversion bioreactor signiﬁcantly reduced nitrate concentrations (58% average reduction) but treated only ~2% of annual ditch ﬂow. Denitriﬁcation potential was signiﬁcantly higher in the in-ditch bioreactor woodchips versus the diversion bioreactor after 25 months (2950 ± 580 vs. 620 ± 310 ng N g−1 dry media h−1). The passive ﬂow design was simple to construct and did not restrict ﬂow in the drainage ditch but resulted in low hydraulic exchange, limiting nitrate removal.</p>

            <p>Cover cropping is beneﬁcial for reducing soil erosion and nutrient losses, but there are conﬂicting reports on how cover cropping affects emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas. In this study, we measured N2O ﬂuxes over a full year in Illinois corn plots with and without rye cover crop. We compared these year-round measurements to N2O emissions predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Tier 1 equation and the Denitriﬁcation-Decomposition (DNDC) model. In addition, we measured potential denitriﬁcation and N2O production rates. The ﬁeld measurements showed typical N2O peaks shortly after fertilizer application, as well as a signiﬁcant late-winter peak. Cover cropping signiﬁcantly reduced all peak N2O ﬂuxes, with decreases ranging from 39 to 95%. Neither model was able to accurately predict annual N2O ﬂuxes or the decrease in N2O emissions from cover-cropped ﬁelds. In contrast to ﬁeld measurements, lab assays found that cover cropping signiﬁcantly increased potential denitriﬁcation by 90–127% and potential N2O production by 54–106%. The rye cover-cropped plots had lower soil nitrate and higher soil carbon. When limiting nitrate and excess carbon were provided in lab assays, the proportion of N2O resulting from denitriﬁcation decreased. These results suggest that the discrepancy between the observed decrease in ﬁeld N2O emissions and the increase in denitriﬁcation potential may be due to the difference in available nutrients between the ﬁeld and laboratory measurements. Overall, these results suggest the importance of late-winter peaks in N2O emissions and the potential of rye cover cropping to reduce N2O emissions from agricultural ﬁelds.</p>

            <p>Due to the contributions of nitrous oxide (N2O) to global climate change and stratospheric ozone destruction, it is important to understand how climate and agricultural management affect N2O emissions. Although the processbased Denitriﬁcation Decomposition (DNDC) model is often used for quantifying emissions of N2O, the accuracy of these predictions remains in question, and it is not clear which input variables, environmental or ﬁeld management, have the greatest effect on model performance. In this study, DNDC was evaluated for prediction of N2O ﬂuxes from two climatically-different corn-ﬁeld sites in the United States (a Colorado irrigated ﬁeld and a Minnesota rainfed ﬁeld). Besides climate, these sites offer the additional advantage that measurements are available for multiple ﬁeld management practices, including fertilizer application, tillage, and crop rotation. This evaluation found that DNDC did not consistently, correctly predict daily-scale N2O ﬂuxes. Cumulative growing season N2O ﬂuxes were signiﬁcantly under-predicted in Colorado and were both under- and over-predicted in Minnesota. Model calibration of four soil input parameters did not signiﬁcantly improve N2O emission predictions at either site or time scale. Modeled and measured N2O ﬂuxes and model error were all strongly correlated with precipitation. Over-predictions of N2O ﬂuxes were associated with heavy precipitation and high modeled denitriﬁcation. Based on our results, model improvements to decrease model error for corn cropping systems in temperate climate zones should focus on better accounting for the effects of precipitation on denitriﬁcation. Despite discrepancies in daily and cumulative growing season N2O ﬂuxes, DNDC correctly identiﬁed the only ﬁeld management (fertilizer application rate) that signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced the measured N2O ﬂuxes.</p>
