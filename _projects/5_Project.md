Enhanced Rock Weathering (ERW) is a process that involves crushing silicate-rich rocks to increase available surface area and applying them to soils to increase carbon dioxide (CO2) uptake. Past studies have depended on mining silicate-rich material; however, we aim to investigate quarry byproducts (QBPs) as an alternative applied directly to agricultural soil to promote CO2 uptake and increase soil fertility. Specifically, the goal of this project is to optimize CO2 uptake though different QBP application rates and incorporation methods, without harmful environmental consequences.
