ABSTRACT={Nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), which contributes to global climate change and stratospheric ozone destruction, can be produced during denitrification. Although the N<sub>2</sub>O ratio, a measure of denitrification completion, is influenced by various properties, studies have largely been limited to site- or treatment-specific conclusions. The primary objective of this study was to identify important factors driving N<sub>2</sub>O ratios and their relationships in soils by systematically reviewing and quantitatively evaluating results from published laboratory denitrification studies. A database with 60 studies (657 observations) was compiled, including studies meeting the minimum criteria: (i) laboratory experiments on soils, (ii) nutrient (carbon and/or nitrogen) addition, and (iii) N<sub>2</sub>O and dinitrogen gas measurements. Of these, 14 studies (100 observations) had sufficient data for inclusion in the meta-analysis to assess the effect of added nutrients on the N<sub>2</sub>O ratio. Furthermore, we modeled the effect of moderators on treatment effect by fitting a meta-regression model with both quantitative and categorical variables. Close review of studies in the database identified soil pH, carbon addition, and nitrogen addition as important variables for the N<sub>2</sub>O ratio, but trends varied across studies. Correlation analysis of all studies clarified that soil pH was significantly correlated with the N<sub>2</sub>O ratio, where soils with higher pH had lower N<sub>2</sub>O ratios. The meta-analysis further revealed that nutrient addition had an overall significant, positive treatment effect (0.30 ± 0.03, P<.0001), indicating that experimentally adding nutrients increased the N<sub>2</sub>O ratio. The model was most significantly improved when soil texture was used as a moderator. The significance of soil texture for the N<sub>2</sub>O ratio was a major finding of this study, especially since the assays were usually conducted with soil slurries. Overall, this study highlights the importance of field soil properties (i.e., pH, texture) and laboratory conditions (i.e., nutrient addition) in driving the N<sub>2</sub>O ratio and N<sub>2</sub>O production from denitrification in soils.}
