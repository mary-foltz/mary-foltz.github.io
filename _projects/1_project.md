The overarching goal of this work is to guide decision-making regarding treatment wetlands to provide a path forward for their design and operation. This project is actively working to obtain primary field and laboratory data on environmental impacts (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions, water quality improvements) associated with different wetland designs. These data will be integrated with uncertainty and sensitivity analyses in quantitative sustainable design to guide and optimize treatment wetland systems. A preliminary life cycle assessment is underway using ranges of uncertainty in available data from the literature but will later be supplemented with primary data to improve overall estimates and recommendations.
