We measure denitrification and nitrous oxide (N2O) production from soils in lab assays. We often measure baseline soil denitrification and then assess how nutrient or soil amendments and/or environmental conditions influence denitrification and N2O production rates. Some focus areas our group has been investigating include pH, texture, nutrients, trace metals, and soil origin. Understanding the factors that influence denitrification and nitrous oxide production can ensure nitrogen is used most efficiently in soils and not lost to the atmosphere as the harmful greenhouse gas N2O.
